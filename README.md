## Project Description
This is a handy tool that encrypts and decrypts messages. This allows you to communicate with secret messages that cannot be understood by others. 

## Rules
You have two options :
- 1: Encrypt a text message wrote in english
- 2: Decrypt an encrypted message

You simply have to press 1 or 2 to chose your option, then input your message to receive the encrypted or decrypted version of it. 

## Workflow
- Product planning : agree on the rules of the game and its main features 
- Flowchart of the game
- Pseudocode, definition of functions/lists/variables names then assignment of the various parts to code 
- Coding
- Presentation

## Organization
To organize our work, we have used Jira to create a project sprint, with different tasks that we could visualise on a kanban board. 

In this repository, we have put the code of the game, the flowchart we have used, the slides presenting the project, as well as a word document where we outlined the workflow and our pseudocode.
